1. The [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flatplat-theme/) is maintained by [@cthbleachbit](https://github.com/cthbleachbit).
2. The [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/tcg/themes/) is maintained by [@LaurentTreguier](https://github.com/LaurentTreguier).

#### Manual Installation

Check the dependencies first.

- GTK+ `>=3.18`
- `gnome-themes-standard`
- Murrine engine - The package name depends on the distro.
  - `gtk-engine-murrine` on Arch Linux
  - `gtk-murrine-engine` on Fedora
  - `gtk2-engine-murrine` on openSUSE
  - `gtk2-engines-murrine` on Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
- `glib-compile-resources` - The package name depends on the distro.
  - `glib2` on Arch Linux
  - `glib2-devel` on Fedora, openSUSE, etc.
  - `libglib2.0-dev` on Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

Install the theme with the following commands.

```sh
cd /tmp && curl -sL https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme/archive/v20170917.tar.gz | tar xz
cd materia-theme-20170917
sudo ./install.sh
```

#### Manual Uninstallation

Delete the installed directories.

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat{,-compact,-dark,-dark-compact,-light,-light-compact}
```

## Recommendations

#### Font

- To properly display the theme, use a font family including `Medium` weight (such as [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto) or [M+](https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp)).
- Set the font size to `9.75` (= 13px at 96dpi) or `10.5` (= 14px at 96dpi).

#### Chrome Theme

To use the Chrome theme,

1. Open the `chrome` folder on `/usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat<-variant>`.
2. Drag and drop the `.crx` files onto the Chrome/Chromium _Extensions_ page: `chrome://extensions`

## GDM Theme

You can change the GDM (lock/login screen) theme by replacing the default GNOME Shell theme.  
However, if it fails, the desktop environment may not operate correctly. So please **be careful** if doing this.

#### :warning: Cautions:
- When applying this, other third-party GNOME Shell themes would look broken until you restore to the original theme.
- If GNOME Shell has been updated, it will be restored to the original theme, so you will need to install this again.

### Installation
1. Select a **GTK+** theme to decide which variant to install.
2. Run the following commands to back up and replace the default theme file.

  ```sh
  GTK_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme | sed "s/'//g")
  sudo cp -v --backup /usr/share{/themes/$GTK_THEME,}/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource
  ```

  > **Note:** If you don't want to overwrite the backup on the second and subsequent runs, delete the `--backup` option.

3. Restart GNOME Shell. (If you are running _GNOME on Xorg_, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> then type `r`.)

### Uninstallation
1. Restore to the original theme from the backup.

  ```sh
  sudo mv -v /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource{~,}
  ```

2. Restart GNOME Shell. (If you are running _GNOME on Xorg_, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> then type `r`.)
