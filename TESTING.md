# TESTING.md

*Package Maintainers!*
This document describes testing procedures for the software contained in this
repository. All sections must be completed and signed off before a package can
be moved from one repository to the next.

## Part 1: Staging -> Proposed (Theme Developer Checks)
* Did it build? Ensure via CI before merging
    - All PRs *MUST* build before merging into other branches
* Are files present in build package:
    - Check package, data.tar - make sure all files intended to be installed are
      there
